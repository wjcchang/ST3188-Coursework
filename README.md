# ST3188-Coursework
A comprehensive market research proposal for Marriott Hotels that applies advanced statistical and multivariate techniques to understand guest attitudes, satisfaction drivers, brand perception and demand for new amenities.

The study integrates stratified sampling, mixed-mode data collection (online surveys and virtual focus groups) and Marriott’s customer database to ensure robust insights. Using tools such as chi-square tests, factor analysis, regression modelling, ANOVA and cluster analysis, the project identifies behavioural patterns, market gaps and competitive benchmarks. The proposal delivers actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction, strengthen brand positioning and guide investment in service innovation, supported by a detailed research schedule, cost plan and full questionnaire design.
